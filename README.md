    Message from me (William Martens)
   
All these I thought of earlier providing, since I was one of the people that got this on my USB stick (my USB got infected long long time ago, Years ago now.) - But now - when I looked closer and I saw that some of these isn't even available online (Some of them are, still - like fanny.bmp and maybe some others, and EVELP4.acm) but not any of mscorwin / comhost, etc. (If they are - I would love to hear that! and the source of it. The more sources of same malware - the better. It strengthens the "community" if I can put it that way. And it is easier to find if all material is gathered at one place.

But I thought of providing all of these to malware researchers. As well as for academical purposes.


(Q) Why would you want to upload malware? You're literally providing CyberWeapons!
(A) I believe in Open-Source, and that even though in this scenario, can hopefully help malware researchers provide better protection.

"I believe in open source, and I am  It is not to do any harm, but do increase people awareness , and hopefully this can help people (like me) interested in this, but also for malware researchers and Analysts."

But the major point, is actually - as said above, but adding the following reason:
- to help the feature find these malware and samples. As I think there are very little (if not none) of these **easily** accessible online. (Samples that is)
